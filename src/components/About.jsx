                <p>Hey there! I am Subhendu Dash, currently an undergrad student in VIT Chennai, persuing Electrical Engineering.</p>
                <p>I usually create interesting stuffs in my leisure time, and that's how my coding journey started.
                    I started with web development when I was in high school and then I started programming in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I never left my coding journey because I enjoyed learning new stuffs on the go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love to watch movies and a lots of web series which feels refreshing to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I play sports occasionally, such as football and badminton. Mostly I play computer games :P.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all about me ;). My motto is to be happy always.
                </p>
                Peace ✌️
